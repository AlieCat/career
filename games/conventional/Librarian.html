dialogue: " How are you? I’m very excited! The school research library was just given boxes of letters from civil war veterans and we’ve digitized them so everyone can read them. We’re going to categorize them by home locations and war locations, so we can better understand what the soldiers’ lives were like. If you want to see the letters, I can take you to the library."
